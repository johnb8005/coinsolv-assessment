# Coinsolv Assesssment

> I used [Vite](https://github.com/nexys-system/boilerplate_vite/) template and [`countries-list`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countries-list) package to create a simple table that displays all the countries of the world, with the `name`, `capital`, `display flag`, and `link to wiki page` columns. I also added a basic search functionality to the app.

## Built with

- Vite React template
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap 5

### Prerequisites

- Node
- NPM / NPX
- Web Browser
- Text Editor (VSCode, Notepad++)

### Setup Scripts

Change working directory to the project's root directory on the terminal, install dependencies with: `yarn install`

In the project directory, you can run: `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make edits.

Script `yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
